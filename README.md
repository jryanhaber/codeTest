## Accelerated Training Component
One part of a system for accelerated algorithm training 

How this works... download and load in 
  - then open the index.html doc in browser
  - open dev tools, minimize window but leave dev tools
  - go to the coding challenges page, copy a code challenge
  - paste in index, solve the challenge
  - repeat, get the next one
  
  
This approach allows for rapid code training due to the following
 - this process of going to the next challenge is fast, making for time 
 spent 99% of the way in solving problemns
 - This allows a native code tool to solve challenges, allowing other acceleration 
 methods like prettier plugins 
 - if your just starting out you can use github copilot 
 
 Other accelerated learning tools... like flashcards... 
 - Solve problems in this order
 First round:  #1 #2
 Second round: #1 #2 #3
 Third round: #1 #2 #3 #4
 
 Only phasing out #1 when you can solve the algo with no help in under 3.5m...

If you work through all of these problems in that fashion, when your done with
this you will be close to interview level

Keep in mind, the first time you solve any of these problems you need to make
sure that you use the console log feature to see and understand exactly why your 
solution makes sense, and it is best to pair this initially with a udemy course
to learn to refine excellent solutions which use linear time complexity 
at some point about 20% into the problems at least, simply solving problems
without accounting for time complexity will get you past only 30% of job interviews, 
and will not get you past the better jobs interviews.
